"""Model service for loading the trained credit approval classifier and
performing predictions.

This module expects a file `model.joblib` (or other name) located in the same
`ml` package directory. The model should follow the scikit-learn API and accept
pandas DataFrames in its `predict` / `predict_proba` methods.

Because we have not run training yet, the service is resilient to missing model
files â€“ it will lazy-load and raise a friendly error if the model is not
available.
